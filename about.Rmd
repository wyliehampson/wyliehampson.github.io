  **Wylie Hampson - ** 
  I am a current graduate student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, and am a part of their first Masters of Environmental Data Science program. Growing up I was always passionate about being outdoors, so I wanted a career that would allow me to contribute to environmental sustainability. I earned a Bachelors of Science degree from the University of Washington in biology, with a focus in ecology, conservation, and evolution. Since 2017, I have worked on the Bellingham, WA aquatic invasive species team, as well as the Washington Conservation Corps, an Americorps program. These positions allowed me to gain insight on conservation work, but I wanted to further my career and apply the more technical math and science skills that I possess to make a larger impact. My current career interests lie in agriculture. My goal is to apply data science tools to assist in finding new agricultural techniques that will not only economically benefit the producers and the consumers, but will also be more environmentally sustainable.
