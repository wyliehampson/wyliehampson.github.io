Growing up in Washington I was always passionate about being outdoors. This eventually lead me to persue a career that would allow me to contribute to environmental sustainability. I earned a Bachelors of Science degree from the University of Washington in biology, with a focus in ecology, conservation, and evolution. After undergrad, I lived in Bellingham, WA where I was able to start my conservation career in various seasonal jobs, mostly involved with field work. These positions allowed me to gain insight on conservation work, but I wanted to further my career and apply the more technical math and science skills that I possessed to make a larger impact. This started my data science journey. When I began to learn more about what an impact data can have on the world I immediately wanted to apply it to conservation. I decided to get my Masters of Environmental Data Science in the inaugural program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. Since earning my degree at UCSB I have been working as a Data Scientist to help develop tools that are helping us better understand the best practices for managing the Colorado River and better benefit the environment and the millions of people that are impacted by it.
