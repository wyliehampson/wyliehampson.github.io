      "contents": "\n\nI am a data analyst working for a small environmental consulting company based out of Tuscon AZ, and I am currently travelling across the U.S. with my partner as we try working remotely from different cities. It has been a blessing to be able to learn and explore in new areas all while working for a cause that I feel so passionately about. Our company focuses on water use from the Colorado River and it has been really rewarding to help contribute to solving some of the issues that our country is facing. In 2022 I graduated from the University of California Santa Barbara with a 4.0 from their inagural Environmental Data Science masters program. Upon graduation I started my new position, first as a 6-month data fellow, and then given a permanent data analyst position. My job has been focused on building data visualizations and apps to help communicate important Colorado River data to stake holders and the public. It has been an extremely rewarding journey full of growth and learning and I am excited to see where it will go from here.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
