      "contents": "\n\n Growing up in Washington I was always passionate\nabout being outdoors. This eventually lead me to persue a career that\nwould allow me to contribute to environmental sustainability. I earned a\nBachelors of Science degree from the University of Washington in\nbiology, with a focus in ecology, conservation, and evolution. After\nundergrad, I lived in Bellingham, WA where I was able to start my\nconservation career in various seasonal jobs, mostly involved with field\nwork. These positions allowed me to gain insight on conservation work,\nbut I wanted to further my career and apply the more technical math and\nscience skills that I possessed to make a larger impact. This started my\ndata science journey. When I began to learn more about what an impact\ndata can have on the world I immediately wanted to apply it to\nconservation. I decided to get my Masters of Environmental Data Science\nin the inaugural program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and\nManagement at UC Santa Barbara. Since earning my degree at UCSB I have\nbeen working as a Data Scientist to help develop tools that are helping\nus better understand the best practices for managing the Colorado River\nand better benefit the environment and the millions of people that are\nimpacted by it.  \n\n\n\n\n\n",
